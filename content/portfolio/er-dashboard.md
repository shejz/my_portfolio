Description: An ER (Emergency Room) status dashboard is a tool used to monitor and display the current status and activity of an emergency room or a hospital's emergency department. By monitoring ER wait time and patient status, hospital staff can better respond to patient needs and deliver a high-quality service that reflects when on the entire organization.
Objectives: The goal is mainly to decrease the average ER (emergency room) wait time, an important metric when it comes to the patientâ€™s experience and satisfaction levels. We can see on this healthcare dashboard the average waiting time broken down by division, which can help spot out which units are facing issues: patients waiting to see a specialist for too long might translate into a lack of training for the staff. or an understaffed unit that needs more nurses and doctors.
Tools: Microsoft Excel, Pivot Table & VBA
